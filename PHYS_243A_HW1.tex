\newline
If we wish to produce a thin-film magnetic storage device with 100 Gbits/in$^2$, each bit is to be 5
times as big in one dimension as the other, the total amount of open area between bits is to be the
same as the total area occupied by the bits, and the film thickness of the medium storing the
information is to be 10 nm, how many atoms are involved in each bit? Assume for simplicity that the
film is pure Co, with a density of 9.0 x 1022 atoms/cm$^3$.
\end{bclogo}
\vspace{1cm}


Let's first visualize our bit with a nice image.

\begin{figure}[H]
 \centering
 \tdplotsetmaincoords{60}{125}
\begin{tikzpicture}
		[tdplot_main_coords,
			cube/.style={very thick,black},
			grid/.style={very thin,gray},
			axis/.style={->,blue,thick}]
	


	%draw the top and bottom of the cube
	\draw[cube] (0,0,0) -- (0,5,0) -- (2,5,0) -- (2,0,0) -- cycle;
	\draw[cube] (0,0,3) -- (0,5,3) -- (2,5,3) -- (2,0,3) -- cycle;
	
	%draw the edges of the cube
	\draw[cube] (0,0,0) -- (0,0,3);
	\draw[cube] (0,5,0) -- (0,5,3);
	\draw[cube] (2,0,0) -- (2,0,3);
	\draw[cube] (2,5,0) -- (2,5,3);
	
	%place labels on the cube edges
	\draw(2,0,1.5) node[anchor=east]{$x$};

	\draw(1, 5, 0) node[anchor=north west]{$10 nm$};
	
\end{tikzpicture}
 \caption{A single bit}
 \label{bit}
\end{figure}

We are told that we want 100 Gbits/in$^2$ and that half of the area is open, thus 
\[
	A_{bits} = 0.5 \,\, \text{in}^2  = 3.23 \times 10^{-4} \,\, \text{m}^2.
\]

Each square inch contains 100 Gbits or $10^11$ bits. We can compare this to the knowledge that a single  bit has an cross sectional area of $A = 5x^2$, so we set up a simple ratio to solve for $x$:

\begin{align*}
	\dfrac{3.23\times 10^{-4} \,\text{m}^2}{10^{11} \,\text{bits}} &= \dfrac{5x^2\,\text{m}^2}{1 \text{bit}}\\[3mm]
	x &= \sqrt{\dfrac{3.23\times10^{-4}}{5\times10^{11}}}\,\,\text{m} \\[3mm]
	x &= 2.54\times 10^{-8} \,\text{m}\\[3mm]
	x &= 25.4 \, \text{nm}
\end{align*}

We can now directly calculate the volume of the bit as pictured in Figure \ref{bit}.
\begin{align*}
	V_{bit\_stack} &= 5(25.4)^2 10\\[3mm]
		&=  32258\,\,\text{nm}^3\\[3mm]
		&= 3.23\times 10^{-17} \,\,\text{cm}^3
\end{align*}

Now we can use the density of Co atoms to find out how many atoms are in a single bit.
\[
\dfrac{3.23\times 10^{-17}\,\text{cm}^3}{1\,\text{bit}} \cdot \dfrac{9\times10^{22}\,\text{atoms}}{1\,\text{cm}^3} = \boxed{ \dfrac{2.9\times 10^6 \,\text{atoms}}{1\,\text{bit}} }
\]

\newline
(a) Begin with the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution for molecular velocities in an ideal gas as
expressed in x,y,z coordinates, and derive by integration the formula for the rate at which molecules
strike a flat surface of unit area perpendicular to one of the axes. From this, determine the time
necessary to form a monolayer of gas on a surface, assuming a general sticking probability of PS. Note
that this is the same derivation that can be found in many physical chemistry texts to predict the rate at
which a gas leaks out through an orifice.
\newline
(b) Now make the assumption that only the bare surface area remaining on the surface after a given
exposure time is active for a particular gas adsorption, and that PS = unity on the bare area, but zero
elsewhere. Derive the general form of PS as a function of time for this case.\newline
(c) If a surface is exposed to 10$^{-9}$ Torr of CO at ambient temperature, how long will it take to form the first monolayer:
\newline 
(i) If Ps = unity?
\newline 
(ii) If Ps follows the relationship of part (b)?
\end{bclogo}
\vspace{2cm}

\subsection*{Part a:}
We begin with the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution for molecules in an ideal gas.
\[
D(v) = \sqrt{\left(\dfrac{m}{2\pi kt}\right)^3}4\pi v^2 \exp{\left(-\dfrac{mv^2}{2kt}\right)}
\]

Where $D$ is the probability of finding a molecule at speed $v$. The speed $v^2 = v_x^2 + v_y^2 + v_z^2$ is in three dimensions. We first want to find the average speed of the molecules, then the flux through a single side of a unit cube when the molecules have a given number density. To find an average speed we add all the speeds up weight by their probability.
\[
	\bar{v}  = \sum v D(v) \Delta v,
\]
where $\Delta v$ represents a discrete spacing of speeds. In reality we can have continuum of speeds so to find the average speed we must sum over all possible speeds, which means an integral.

\begin{align*}
	\bar{v} &= \int_{0}^{\infty} v D(v) dv \\[3mm]
		&= \int_{0}^{\infty} \sqrt{\left(\dfrac{m}{2\pi kt}\right)^3}4\pi v^3 \exp{\left(-\dfrac{mv^2}{2kt}\right)} \\[3mm]
		&= \left(\dfrac{m}{2\pi kt}\right)^{3/2} 4\pi \int_{0}^{\infty} v^3 \exp{\left(-\dfrac{mv^2}{2kt}\right)}
\end{align*}
	
Now we make a substitution to make the integration easier: $$x = mv^2/2kt$$. Finding dx/dv and $v^2$ in terms of $x$,  we make the substitutions and get,

\[
	\bar{v} = \left(\dfrac{m}{2\pi kt}\right)^{3/2} 4\pi\left(\dfrac{kt}{m}\right) \left(\dfrac{2kt}{m}\right) \int_{0}^{\infty} x \exp{\left(-x\right)}
\]

Looking up this solution in a table (I used Schaums) we find that the integral evaluates to unity and we end up with.

\begin{align*}
	\bar{v} &=  \left(\dfrac{m}{2\pi kt}\right)^{3/2} 4\pi\left(\dfrac{kt}{m}\right) \left(\dfrac{2kt}{m}\right)\\[3mm]
		&= \sqrt{\dfrac{8kT}{\pi m}}
\end{align*}
	
The flux of particles on the surfaces of a cube will be
\[
 J_{cube} = n\bar{v},
\]
where $n$ is the number density of particles (or molecules) and $\bar{v}$ is the average speed of the particles. The particles are traveling in all directions with equal probability and at the same speed. We are only interested in the flux through a single face so we say,
\[J_{face} = \dfrac{1}{6}n\bar{v}\].
The number density is just the number of molecules per volume or $N/V$. Using the ideal gas law we can re-write the flux of particles as,
\[
	J_{face} = \dfrac{1}{6}\dfrac{P}{kT} \sqrt{\dfrac{8kT}{\pi m}}.
\]
Simplifying we get,
\[
	J_{face} = P\sqrt{\dfrac{2}{9\pi mkT}}\quad \text{molecules}/\text{m}^2\cdot \text{s}
\]

With this we can say that the number of molecules that will stick on a typical surface of area $A$ per second is,
\[
	\alpha = J_{face}P_s At
\]
where $P_s$ is some general sticking probability for the impinging molecules/atoms/particles. If we divide out the area of the surface then we get the surface density of the layer on the surface after a time $t$.
\[
	\rho = J_{face}P_s t
\]
If we assume that the sticking probability is unity and that a typical suface density is $\approx 10^{15}$ molecules/m$^2$ then we can estimate the time it takes to form a monolayer under various pressures. We use nitrogen gas as an example since it behaves as an ideal gas in many cases.
\begin{align*}
	t(P) &= \dfrac{10^{15}}{P}\sqrt{\dfrac{9\pi mkT}{2}}\\[3mm]
		&\approx \dfrac{2.2\times10^{-7}}{P[\text{Torr}]}\quad \text{seconds}.
\end{align*}
If the pressure of the chamber is about 10$^{-6}$ Torr then the time to form a monolayer will be,
\[
	t \approx 0.2 \quad \text{seconds}.
\]
